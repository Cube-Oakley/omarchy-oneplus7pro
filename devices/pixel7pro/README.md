# Omarchy Mobile · Pixel 7 Pro

Bringing native Linux and the Omarchy desktop experience to the Pixel 7 Pro
(`cheetah`, Tensor G2 / GS201). The OnePlus 7 Pro project is the reference for
bring-up methods and the eventual mobile interface.

**Status: accelerated shared mobile shell and working CRT screen power;
persistent installation in progress, September 26, 2026.** Mainline Linux runs Arch Linux
ARM and the shared Hyprland/Quickshell mobile shell from installed ext4 storage. Mali-G710 rendering,
clean 120 Hz scanout, bounded CPU scaling and seven thermal zones are verified.
The new S2MPG12 input driver and DRM panel off/on path have a user-confirmed
sleep/wake cycle with clean CRT transitions and no console flash.
The Pixel uses the same CRT animation and power-key policy as the OnePlus.

This phone is dedicated to Linux. Android userdata has been replaced with ext4
after verified UFS reads and explicit authorization. The write/readback check
passes and the installed Arch desktop has been validated; native boot-slot installation is in progress.
Recovery uses the bootloader and saved host images. See the
[active implementation record](docs/persistence-power-20260925.md).

## What works

| Area | Verified result |
|---|---|
| Recovery baseline | Unlocked bootloader and saved factory images; boot partitions checked by SHA256 before installation. |
| Native boot | Linux 7.3.0-rc2, embedded initramfs, all eight CPUs online. |
| Display | Native 1440×3120 DMA scanout, real page flips, validated 60/120 Hz modes and memory-bandwidth floor. |
| Wayland | Hyprland on Mali-G710 MC7, shared mobile shell and clean fullscreen animation at 119.6–120.2 fps; older software-rendered fallback preserved. |
| CPU/thermal | Three bounded cpufreq policies, schedutil, seven thermal zones and cooling tests. |
| Power key/display sleep | S2MPG12 press/release, panel off/on and clean shared CRT transitions confirmed; CPU stays awake. |
| Internal storage | All UFS logical units discovered; boot hashes match and ext4 write/remount/readback passes. The installed Arch desktop runs from userdata. |
| Physical touch | S3908 GPIO SPI input reached Hyprland; user confirmed response, but it is slow. |
| USB | DWC3 peripheral using inherited PHY state; concurrent USB2 CDC-ACM and CDC-ECM Ethernet. |
| Shell | Native root BusyBox shell, job control, RAM files, shell restart after exit, command exit-status reporting. |
| Arch userspace | Same cached Arch Linux ARM base as OnePlus; native Bash, glibc, pacman and OpenSSH. |
| Network transfer | Private USB link, key-only SSH, 8 MiB SFTP roundtrip with matching hashes. |
| Boot watchdogs | Both inherited AP watchdogs stopped; two-minute runtime verified before the longer shell test. |
| Recovery | Power + Volume Down reaches the bootloader; verified host images are retained. Android userdata has been replaced. |

Autonomous boot validation, faster UFS, complete panel rail/PHY control,
battery/charging and CPU suspend remain unfinished. Image G was RAM-booted,
but its Arch userspace now runs from internal storage. Slot B is **not** a recovery fallback.

## Connect

Use the current connection and installation state in [status](docs/status.md).
The following commands describe the historical RAM recovery image, from
`devices/pixel7pro/` on the computer with the phone in fastboot.
The helper needs the handset serial, which stays local: set `PHONE_SERIAL` or
put it on one line in ignored `out/device.serial`.

```sh
python scripts/boot-pixel-shell.py
python scripts/pixel-shell.py
```

The boot helper verifies the image hash, phone identity and slot state, then
uses `fastboot boot`. The default v9 image reboots after ten minutes.
`Ctrl-]` disconnects the terminal; `exit` restarts the phone's shell; `reboot`
restarts the phone. Android userdata is no longer present.

For a single command:

```sh
python scripts/pixel-shell.py --command 'id; uname -a; cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/online'
```

The host's USB serial access rule is installed. Full setup, build instructions,
