# Experimental Mali-G710 Mesa enablement

Tested with Mesa 26.2.3 on the Pixel 7 Pro's native v15 B2 kernel. The two-line
model addition enables the real G710 architecture10.8/product2/variant0; it does
not spoof the device as a G610. Core parameters match the G610's shared shader
architecture. No GLES conformance claim is made.

Hardware acceptance: a GLES shader returned RGBA64,128,191,255, no GL error;
renderer `Mali-G710 MC7 (Panfrost)`. A second run after runtime suspend passed via
the display-only card0/kmsro route. Hyprland/Aquamarine selected renderD128 and
produced a captured shared mobile desktop through the retained-display bridge.

## Inputs and build

Work directory: `out/checkpoints/20260925-gpu-v15/`.

- Official source: https://archive.mesa3d.org/mesa-26.2.3.tar.xz
- Source SHA256: `1628058a8d2c0615975de5a15ab7bbb9638c50000b5bed9456ff423ea034a81f`.
- Patch: `0001-panfrost-add-g710-model.patch` (apply with `patch -p1`).
- ARM sysroot: `usr/include`, `usr/lib`, `usr/share/pkgconfig` and
  `usr/share/wayland-protocols` from the unchanged mobile Arch archive, SHA256
  `9b204df8aff3f54625f347d11d4e1370b44a83aef12e6371d588c8581ba54e57`.
- Cross toolchain: aarch64-linux-gnu GCC16.1.0, binutils2.47.
- Isolated Python environment: Meson1.12.1, Mako1.4.3, PyYAML6.0.3,
  packaging26.3, MarkupSafe3.0.3. Ninja1.13.2.
- Host LLVM22.1 plus SPIRV-Tools2026.3.1. The additional host package
  `spirv-llvm-translator-22.1.6-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst` was extracted into
  `host-deps/`, not installed system-wide. SHA256
  `d7582c62782e073795b1bdf9d7cbe2c953e93d8bb756a5b3813b7ac36085ed0e`.
  Its pkgconfig prefix was adjusted to that extracted `usr` directory.

Build the matching Mesa host `mesa_clc`, `vtn_bindgen2`, and `panfrost_compile`
first. The saved `host-build-options.json`, `cross-build-options.json`,
`mesa-cross.ini`, and configure/build logs record exact options. Host configuration
uses no graphics drivers, enables mesa-clc, tools=panfrost, install-mesa-clc and
install-precomp-compiler. Keep the isolated Python environment in PATH during
configure, regeneration and builds. Expose the three host executables in PATH.

The ARM build uses gallium-drivers=panfrost, vulkan-drivers empty,
platforms=wayland, glvnd enabled, LLVM disabled, mesa-clc=system and
precomp-compiler=system. Rusticl, VA, GLX, GLES1, tests, sensors, libunwind and
Valgrind are disabled. Prefix `/opt/pixel-mesa`, libdir `lib`, release build.
`mesa-cross.ini` and the two option records name the device workspace as
`@PIXEL_ROOT@` in place of the absolute path used for the build; substitute it
(or regenerate) when reproducing. Its compiler/linker sysroot and pkgconfig paths must point to ARM files.

## Test package and replay

Saved package: `out/checkpoints/20260925-gpu-v15/mesa-g710.tar.gz`, SHA256
`2e33b3b94fff1792a1d94941e9bf76fb44fadeecde9a20e72fbbb40b5ca12f68`.
It contains only `opt/pixel-mesa/`; extract into the phone's RAM root after Arch
restore. It replaces no distro libraries. Environment for opted-in clients:

```sh
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/pixel-mesa/lib
export GBM_BACKENDS_PATH=/opt/pixel-mesa/lib/gbm
export __EGL_VENDOR_LIBRARY_FILENAMES=/opt/pixel-mesa/share/glvnd/egl_vendor.d/50_mesa.json
unset GBM_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE GALLIUM_DRIVER MESA_LOADER_DRIVER_OVERRIDE
timeout 25 /root/pixel-gpu-render-test /dev/dri/renderD128
```

Compile the probe from `mainline/pixel-gpu-render-test.c` with the ARM compiler,
EGL/GLES headers and `-ldl`. Copy it into `/root` on the phone. The
`scripts/pixel-gpu-session-start.sh` launcher checks a shader before starting the
hardware-rendered Hyprland and shared mobile UI. Existing v11 software launchers
remain separate fallback recipes. The old saved terminal banner says “software
display”; it is static text, not renderer detection.

Shared OS packages and the OnePlus project remain unchanged. The model patch is
a candidate for an eventual shared Mesa package after broader validation; the
Pixel session launcher and experimental kernel remain device-specific.
