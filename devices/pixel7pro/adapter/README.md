# Pixel 7 Pro development adapter

These files connect the shared Omarchy mobile overlay to the verified Pixel
native Hyprland session. They are source-development artifacts, not host desktop
configuration. Install them only inside the target Arch root.

- `mobile.json`: display scale, keyboard dimensions and common shortcut settings.
  The display driver's preferred mode is used; no OnePlus 90 Hz assumption.
- `desktop-prepare.sh`: sources the shared generated mobile config into
  `/root/pixel-hyprland.lua` after checking a validated Pixel kernel and RAM or marked persistent root. No register,
  partition, clock, charging, suspend or radio operations.
- `quickshell-bootstrap.qml`: optional entry point that inherits the caller's
  Wayland environment. The tested host-driven entry is
  `scripts/pixel-mobile-start.sh`, which discovers the live compositor instance.
- `kernel/`: pinned mainline base, complete bring-up patches and configurations.

Shared shell source remains owned by the common mobile layer. Both devices now use `overlay/mobile/` in the merged repository. The current
Pixel test installs that shared source with this device adapter. Do not copy
OnePlus hardware control adapters here.
