# Start the mobile shell again if it exits. Without it nothing draws the
# screen or answers the power button's animation, so the phone looks dead
# (September 24: Hyprland 0.56.2 disconnected the shell when a window closed
# during a preview capture). One per session: the session's prepare step starts
# it every time the shell starts, and the lock keeps the first. A deliberate
# restart takes under a second, so the shell must be missing twice, 3 s apart;
# quickshell -n refuses a second copy anyway. The screen is left as it was.
# A shell that dies leaves its helpers running, and the new one starts its
# own: they are stopped first, found in the dead shell's session (the shell
# leads one) by name, so the board start scripts the session also started are
# left alone.
